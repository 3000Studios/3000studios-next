# Music Directory

This directory is for background music files used in the application.

## Expected Files:
Background music tracks for the site's ambient audio system.

## Format Guidelines:
- Use MP3 format for maximum compatibility
- Optimize audio files (128-192 kbps is usually sufficient for background music)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 5MB per track)
- Consider looping capabilities

## Usage:
Music files are referenced in the `BackgroundMusic` component.
Example: `/music/ambient-track-1.mp3`

## Volume Guidelines:
- Background music should be subtle and not interfere with user experience
- Default volume should be low (around 20-30%)
- Always provide user controls to mute/adjust volume

## Note:
Ensure you have proper licensing for any music files used.
