### ⏳ Remaining (5% - Requires GitHub Permissions)

#### 5. ⏳ Single Main Branch
**Status: REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION**

**Current State:**
```
Branches on GitHub:
├── main (35d3035)
├── copilot/clean-and-deploy-new-ui (a1c3dbe) ← This PR with all cleanup
└── copilot/merge-deployment-fixes (3f519f0) ← To be deleted
```

**Required Actions:**
1. **Merge PR #80** (`copilot/clean-and-deploy-new-ui` → `main`)
2. **Delete** `copilot/merge-deployment-fixes` branch

**Why Not Automated:**
- Sandbox environment cannot authenticate with GitHub
- Branch merge requires GitHub permissions
- Branch deletion requires GitHub admin permissions
- This is a security feature, not a limitation

**After Completion:**
```
Branches on GitHub:
└── main (latest) ← Single clean branch ✅
```
