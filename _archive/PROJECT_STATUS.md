## 🔧 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Google Fonts loading**: Currently using system fonts (internet restriction)
   - Impact: Low
   - Fix: Enable Google Fonts access or use local font files

2. **Form submissions**: Placeholder logic only
   - Impact: Medium
   - Fix: Add backend API routes

3. **Console warnings**: React key warnings in some components
   - Impact: Low
   - Fix: Add unique keys to all mapped elements

### Future Improvements

- Add unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Optimize image loading with placeholders
- Add service worker for offline support
- Implement proper SEO meta tags per page
